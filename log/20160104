I'm not the first one using Github as a blog. Reason I didn't choose Google doc is I'm reluctant to spend my time and figure out whether it could be set to publicly accessible and searchable there. I'm definitely trying to avoid using "lazy" to label myself. There's this theory that when you believe what you are, you will become what you are.
And actually the main reason is I'm trying to believe I love Github and the meaning behind it.
I'm trying to be a good participant in this field.
