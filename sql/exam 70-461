SQL is based on set theory and predicate logic
A predicate is an expression that when attributed to some object, makes a proposition either true or false.
Set should be considered as a whole, thus iterative solutions should be avoided.
An Ordered result is not relational. SQL calls it a cursor.


window function

framing: 
rows between unbounded preceding and current row (default is range, rows is more optimized though)
rows between current row and unbounded following
rows between n preceding and current row (where n is for n rows preceding current row)

Unlike grouped queries, which hide the detail rows and return only one row per group, windowed queries do not hide the detail. They return a row per each row in the underlying query, and allow mixing detail elements and window functions in the same expressions.
